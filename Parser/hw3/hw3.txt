Presently there are no shift/reduce or reduce-reduce errorrs. 
Most of the shift reduce were handled by rewriting the grammar appropriately. 
Or by using the precedence and associativity of the grammar in the ml-yacc file.
One of handling the problem on page 82 as memntioned by the Professor in 
moodle post is to either use left or right recursion to postpone the processing.
