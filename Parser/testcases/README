CSci 5161 --- Test cases for the Tiger compiler

There are a few different kinds of tests that are useful depending on
which phase of compiler writing you are currently at. In the
beginning, during syntactic (lexer and parser) and semantic analysis
(type checking, escape calculation etc) the syntax-and-sem-analysis
tests are probably most useful; use the one example in comments to
check the treatment of comments during lexical analysis. Later, when
generating intermediate code, the test cases in translation may be
relevant. Eventually, when testing the MIPS code that is generated,
the tests in full-compiler-tests that actually contain meaningful
programs that should produce recognizable results would be useful.
